# types of objects
  - ***standard objects*** : _provided by salesforce._
      - Account - are the companies you’re doing business with.
      - Contacts - are the people who work at an Account.
      - Leads - are potential prospects.
      - Opportunities - are qualified leads that you’ve converted.
  - ***custom objects*** : _created by admin._

<br/>

***Every standard and custom object has fields attached to it.***

# types of fields
***standard fields***
  - when we create an object some fields (such as Name, CreatedById, OwnerId, LastModifiedById) are already created by salesforce those fields are known as standard fields.

***custom fields***
  - those fields that are created by admin are called custom fields.
  - these fields have ``__c`` in their field name.

***there are ``24`` data types for custom fields***

---

  - ``Auto Number``	A system-generated sequence number that uses a display format you define. The number is automatically incremented for each new record.
  - ``Formula``	A read-only field that derives its value from a formula expression you define. The formula field is updated when any of the source fields change.
  - ``Roll-Up Summary`` A read-only field that displays the sum, minimum, or maximum value of a field in a related list or the record count of all records listed in a related list. ***only available to master in a master-detail relationship.***

---

  - ``Lookup Relationship``	Creates a relationship that links this object to another object. The relationship field allows users to click on a lookup icon to select a value from a popup list. The other object is the source of the values in the list.
  - ``Master-Detail Relationship``	Creates a special type of parent-child relationship between this object (the child, or "detail") and another object (the parent, or "master") where:
    - The relationship field is required on all detail records.
    - The ownership and sharing of a detail record are determined by the master record.
    - When a user deletes the master record, all detail records are deleted.
    - You can create rollup summary fields on the master record to summarize the detail records.
    - The relationship field allows users to click on a lookup icon to select a value from a popup list. The master object is the source of the values in the list.
  - ``External Lookup Relationship``	Creates a relationship that links this object to an external object whose data is stored outside the Salesforce org.
 
---

  - ``Checkbox``	Allows users to select a True (checked) or False (unchecked) value.
  - ``Currency``	Allows users to enter a dollar or other currency amount and automatically formats the field as a currency amount. This can be useful if you export data to Excel or another spreadsheet.
  - ``Date``	Allows users to enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar.
  - ``Date/Time``	Allows users to enter a date and time, or pick a date from a popup calendar. When users click a date in the pop-up, that date and the current time are entered into the Date/Time field.
  - ``Email``	Allows users to enter an email address, which is validated to ensure proper format. If this field is specified for a contact or lead, users can choose the address when clicking Send an Email. Note that custom email addresses cannot be used for mass emails.
  - ``Geolocation``	Allows users to define locations. Includes latitude and longitude components, and can be used to calculate distance.
  - ``Number``	Allows users to enter any number. Leading zeros are removed.
  - ``Percent``	Allows users to enter a percentage number, for example, '10' and automatically adds the percent sign to the number.
  - ``Phone``	Allows users to enter any phone number. Automatically formats it as a phone number.
  - ``Picklist``	Allows users to select a value from a list you define.
  - ``Picklist`` (Multi-Select)	Allows users to select multiple values from a list you define.
  - ``Text``	Allows users to enter any combination of letters and numbers.
  - ``Text Area``	Allows users to enter up to 255 characters on separate lines.
  - ``Text Area (Long)``	Allows users to enter up to 131,072 characters on separate lines.
  - ``Text Area (Rich)``	Allows users to enter formatted text, add images and links. Up to 131,072 characters on separate lines.
  - ``Text (Encrypted)`` 
Allows users to enter any combination of letters and numbers and store them in encrypted form.
  - ``Time``	Allows users to enter a local time. For example, "2:40 PM", "14:40", "14:40:00", and "14:40:50.600" are all valid times for this field.
  - ``URL``	Allows users to enter any valid website address. When users click on the field, the URL will open in a separate browser window.

## field dependencies
**💡 tip:** **when we have to create dependent fields values in picklist**(_ex: state depend on country_) **we can create ``field dependencies``.**

<details>
  <summary> <b>example</b> </summary>
<p>

<br/>


## picklist value set
**💡 tip:** **when we have to use same picklist values more than once we can create ``picklist value set``.**

<br/>


## Validation rules
- validation rules fires on both insertion & updation also.
- if we wan't validation rule to throw error only for new records or updated records we can use IsNew() or IsChanged() functions in formula respectively.

> **Note:** When writing a validation rule, your condition formula should return “true” for your error condition. 
> <br/> ex: ``Trip_End_Date__c < Trip_Start_Date__c``

<br/>


## Duplicate rules using Matching rules
- A duplicate rule **defines what happens when a user views a record with duplicates** or **starts creating a duplicate record.**

- Using Feed Tracking, users can see updates for records they follow in their Chatter feed. We can track only up to 20 fields per object.
- Auto-number, formula, and roll-up summary fields, Encrypted and read-only system fields can't be tracked.

> **note:** In lightning app builder, chatter components are available only to objects that have their feed tracking enabled.
  
</td> 
<td> 

- You can select certain fields to track and display the field history in the History related list of an object. 
- The field history data is retained for up to 18 months.

# types of object relationships

### 1. ***look up relationship***
  - child declares lookup to parent object
  - 0,1 to many
  - SOQL 
    - ***child to parent*** : SELECT id,name, parent__r.id FROM Child__c
    - ***parent to child*** : SELECT id, name, (SELECT id,name FROM Childs__r) FROM parent__c  
  - ex: in Account > Contact 
    - Contact is child
    - Contact has a look up to Account
    - Contact can exist without Account
    - Contact can access properties of parent Account
    
    
<details>   
<summary> <b> important note: </b> </summary>
<p>

---

<b>Lookup Filter:</b> Optionally, create a filter to limit the records available to users in the lookup field. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63545175/215242566-c23e8ffd-d63e-42bd-b2a5-6a42c7dfa73f.png)


<b> Making a Lookup behave as a master-detail relationship </b>

---

</p>
</details>

<br/>

### 2. ***master detail relationship***
  - child can not exist without parent
  - 1 to many
  - _important_
    - one object can have max 2 master detail relationships
    - parent account(master) can have roll up summary
    - ownership and sharing of detail record is determined by master record.
    - When a user deletes the master record, all detail records are deleted.
  - _SOQL_
    - ***child to parent*** : SELECT id,name, parent__r.id FROM Child__c
    - ***parent to child*** : SELECT id, name, (SELECT id,name FROM Childs__r) FROM parent__c
  - ex: in Debit Card > transactions
    - transaction is child
    - transaction has a master-detail to debit-card
    - transaction can not exist without debit-card

<br/>

### 3. ***many-to-many ``junction object``***
  - many to many relationship
  - _SOQL_
    - ***child to parent*** : ????
    - ***parent to child*** : ????
  - ex: customer > C_D < Dish | Opportunity > Account < Contact
    - 1 customer can have many dish and vice-versa.
    - 1 opp can be related to many customer and vice-versa.

<details>
<summary> <b> more examples: </b> </summary>  
<p>  
  
---
  
#### customer > Order < product  
  - 1 ---> many,many <--- 0,1
  - every time an order is created the product will show up in customer related list and customer will show up in product related list.
  - if customer is deleted all orders will get deleted, if product is deleted no order will be deleted
  - ❌ junction
                          
#### teacher > course < student
  - many ---> 1,1 <--- many
  - if course is deleted records of both students and teachers will be deleted.
  - ❌ not junction

#### Correct junction
  - 1 ---> many,many <--- 1
  - only master detail relationship
  - ✅ junction

</p>  
</details>

<br/>

### 4. ***Hierarchical Relationship***
  - 1:1 relationship, available only on user object
  - one user is linked to another user, through Manager related list

> **NOTE:** we can link account to parent account, also there is option to link case to another case. the relationship here is self relationship.

<br/>
  
### 5. ***External lookup relationship***  
  - ????
  
### relationship limit, relationship conversion, self relationship ????
