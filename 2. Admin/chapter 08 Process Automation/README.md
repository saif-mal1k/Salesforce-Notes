- Users with these permissions can respond to approval requests, even if they aren‚Äôt designated approvers.
    - ‚ÄúModify All Data‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúModify All‚Äù for an object    
- Make sure that the assigned approver has access to read the records for the approval requests.
    - example: a user who can‚Äôt view expense records can‚Äôt view expense approval requests.    
- Approval processes that let users select an approver manually also let users select themselves as the approver.
   

- ensure submit for approval button & lightning action in record page layout, also add approval history related list.
- on record page, Submit for Approval button is available when record is not already submitted for approval and gets hidden after the record is submitted for approval.
    
- ERROR: ``no applicable approval process was found`` occurs, if
    - approval process is not active
    - approval process entry criteria is not met
        - try to dry run, to debug the process    
    
- Admin Permissions
    - Users with one of these permissions are considered approval admins.
        - Modify All object-level permission for the given object

    - Approval admins can:
        - Approve or reject pending approval requests without being part of the approval process
        - Edit records that have been locked for approval    
    
- Activating Approval Processes
    - An approval process must have at least one step before you can activate it.
    - Before you activate your approval process, test it in your Salesforce sandbox.
    - After an approval process is activated, you can‚Äôt add, delete, or change the order of the steps or change its reject or skip behavior, even if the process is inactive.

***sales force provides two types of automation tools -***
1. **Declarative tools**
    - Approval process
    - Workflow rules
    - process builder
    - flow builder
2. **programatic tools**
    - apex triggers
    


<br/>

    
    
### workflow vs process builder vs flow builder
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63545175/189529873-cb1f173e-1873-4a64-a3da-5dba57ab1ed3.png" width="780px">


<br/>



>**üí° tip:** if an object has all the automation tools applied the execution will be in the order. <br/>
>_Duplicate rule_ **``<``** _validation rule_ **``<``** workflow rules **``<``** process builder **``<``** flow builder **``<``** apex triggers.


<br/>


## when to use another tool
- Approve records through multiple levels in your organization.
    - Approval process
- Perform an operation for more records than scheduled-triggered flows allow.
    - Batch Apex
- Perform CPU-intensive operations.	
    - Apex
