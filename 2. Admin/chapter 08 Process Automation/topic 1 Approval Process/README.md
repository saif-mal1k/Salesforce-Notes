    - “Modify All” for an object    
- Make sure that the assigned approver has access to read the records for the approval requests.
    - example: a user who can’t view expense records can’t view expense approval requests.    
- Approval processes that let users select an approver manually also let users select themselves as the approver.
   

- ensure submit for approval button & lightning action in record page layout, also add approval history related list.
- on record page, Submit for Approval button is available when record is not already submitted for approval and gets hidden after the record is submitted for approval.
