<details>
<summary> <b> Which flow Resource (Variable) to use when .... </b> </summary>
<p>

- In a screen flow, store the ID of the record that the flow is displayed on, so you can tell the flow which record to update at the end of the flow.
- Store a number value that can be higher or lower depending on user choices.
- Store the result of joining two text strings together.
- Retrieve record values to use in calculations, copy to another record, or display to a user.
- Assemble a collection of values that you can use to create a record.
- Make changes to every record that meets certain criteria.
- Delete every record that meets certain criteria.
- Keep a running tally of how many times a loop has run.

> **Note:** we don’t have to create variables for stoing every flow output. Many flow elements output their own variables, and it’s often best to use those variables.

### Fast Fields Update
- updates fields on the record that triggered the flow
- **runs before** the record is saved 
    
### Actions and Related Records
- update any record and perform action
- **runs after** record is saved

### run asynchronously 
- divide flow into 2 scheduled paths ``run immediately`` & ``run asynchronously``

### scheduled paths
- a path that executes on a scheduled time

<summary> <h3> create <code>related</code> records </h3> </summary>
<p>

---

**Field: WhatId**
The ``WhatId`` field can refer to the ID of any related non-human object. It represents something other than a person, such as an account, opportunity, campaign, case, or custom object. To refer to a person object, such as contact, use ``WhoId``.

**Value: $Record > Id**
Remember, data from the record that triggered the flow is stored in the $Record variable. To reference the record itself, drill down from $Record to the Id field.

## Security in Flow ????
very short complete quick: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_distribute_security.htm&type=5 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63545175/196874109-ec539e9c-1105-4651-a382-ae4a3264e1ac.png)

- this option is available while saving flow under **``show advanced``** button.
    - the default ``User or system context`` : how the flow is launched determines whether the flow runs in the context of the user or the system. 
    - If you choose ``system context with sharing`` : the flow respects record level security.
        - org-wide default settings, 
        - role hierarchies, 
        - sharing rules, 
        - manual sharing, 
        - teams, and territories. 
        - >_**Note:** it doesn't respect object permissions, field-level access, or other permissions of the running user._
    - If you choose ``system context without sharing`` : the flow can access all data.



<br/>

## Automate surveys ????
very short complete quick: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/automated-survey-invitations-with-flows


<br/>


## Best Practices & things to remember
- Scheduled Paths are used in Record-Triggered Flows to automate steps at a designated time.
- A record must be created or updated to set it on a Scheduled Path.
- Scheduled Paths can be based on any date or date/time field on the object.
- Loops look through a collection and apply changes to individual items
- Decision elements are not required in loops
- _Keep data elements outside of the loop to increase efficiency_
- All new Flow Builder automations should be tested with debug
- **Reveal outcomes:** see what happens at each step of the flow
- **Execute as another user:** see what happens when another user runs the flow
    - in setup type, goto ``Process Automation Settings`` check ``Let admins debug flows as other users``
- Debug in a **sandbox org** and use ``rollback mode`` to protect data integrity


<br/>

## Keyboard Shortcuts
| Action | Keyboard shortcut |
|--------|-------------------|
| Zoom in | ``CTRL+=`` |
| Zoom out | ``CTRL+-`` |
| Zoom to fit | ``CTRL+Alt+1`` |
| Zoom to view | ``CTRL+Alt+0`` |
| Switch focus to another panel | ``F6`` |
