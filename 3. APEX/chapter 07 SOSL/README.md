## SOSL
- **Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL)** is a Salesforce search language that is used to perform text searches in records. 
- Use SOSL to search fields across multiple standard and custom object records in Salesforce. 
- SOSL is similar to Apache Lucene.
- When SOSL is embedded in Apex, it is referred to as inline SOSL

***example:***
```apex
List<List<SObject>> searchList = [FIND 'SFDC' IN ALL FIELDS 
                                      RETURNING Account(Name), Contact(FirstName,LastName)];
```

> A list of lists of sObjects is returned as a result of SOSL search.


<br/>

### executing SOSL in Query Editor
```
FIND {Wingo} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Name), Contact(FirstName,LastName,Department)
```

> ***Note ðŸ’¡:*** _The search query in the Query Editor and the API must be enclosed within curly brackets ({Wingo}). In contrast, in Apex the search query is enclosed within single quotes ('Wingo')._

## Differences and Similarities Between SOQL and SOSL
- Like SOQL, SOSL allows you to search your organizationâ€™s records for specific information. 
- Unlike SOQL, which can only query one standard or custom object at a time, a single SOSL query can search all objects.

**SOQL and SOSL are two separate languages with different syntax. Each language has a distinct use case:**
- Use SOQL to retrieve records for a single object.
- Use SOSL to search fields across multiple objects. SOSL queries can search most text fields on an object.

<br/>

<br/>


## SOSL Syntax
**SOSL allows you to specify the following search criteria:**
- Text expression (single word or a phrase) to search for
- Scope of fields to search
- List of objects and fields to retrieve
- Conditions for selecting rows in the source objects

<br/>

***This is the syntax of a basic SOSL query:***
```
  FIND 'SearchQuery' [IN SearchGroup] [RETURNING ObjectsAndFields]
```

- SearchQuery is the text to search for (a single word or a phrase). 
- single word should be enclosed in single quotes, phrase should be enclosed in double quotes.
- **Text searches are case-insensitive.** For example, searching for ``Customer, customer, or CUSTOMER`` all return the same results.
- SearchGroup is optional, Default is ALL FIELDS.
  - _choose from_ 
    - ALL FIELDS
    - NAME FIELDS
    - EMAIL FIELDS
    - PHONE FIELDS
    - SIDEBAR FIELDS


### searching with in single object
```apex

  FIND {term} RETURNING ObjectTypeName

```

```apex
// example
FIND {march 2016 email} RETURNING Campaign

```


### searching with in multiple objects
```apex

  FIND {term} RETURNING ObjectTypeName1, ObjectTypeName2, ObjectTypeNameYouGetTheIdea

```

```apex
// example
FIND {recycled materials} RETURNING Material__c, ContentVersion, FeedItem  

```
