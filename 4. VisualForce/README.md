## Visualforce vs LWC
| Tool | Job | why |
|------|-----|----------------|
| LWC | Developing for Lightning Experience	| Lightning Experience was built with Lightning Components. these custom components(_UI elements_) can be added to any page using Lightning App Builder.|
| LWC | Developing for mobile app | Visualforce can be a poor match for mobile apps with limited, high-latency network connections and limited compute resources. Lightning Components, by contrast, was designed specifically to handle this context.|
| Visualforce | Building a Page-Centric Experience with Limited Client-Side Logic | Use Visualforce pages to ensure development velocity and manageability.|
| Visualforce | Building an Interactive Experience with JavaScript and I Need a Third-Party Framework | Use a Visualforce page as a container for your third-party framework such as React |
