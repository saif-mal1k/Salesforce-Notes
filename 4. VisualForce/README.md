# visualforce
Visualforce is a ``web development framework`` based on standard web technology of JS framework, it is designed primarily ``to build page-centric mobile and desktop apps``, that can align with the ``styling of Lightning Experience.`` 

> Visualforce processes markup tags on the Salesforce server. **Lightning Components process markup on the client.** The advantage of processing on the client is that the HTML block for the entire page isnâ€™t passed back and forth between the client and the server with every interaction.

> Visualforce characteristic i.e page-centric orientation, can be a poor match for mobile apps with limited, high-latency network connections and limited compute resources. **Lightning Components, by contrast, was designed specifically to handle this context.**

## Visual force vs LWC
| Tool | Job | why |
|------|-----|----------------|
| LWC | Developing for Lightning Experience	| Lightning Experience was built with Lightning Components, and the two fit together like hand and glove. Use Lightning Components to create custom components that can be used in the Lightning App Builder. create custom UI elements then add them to any page using app builder.|
| LWC | Developing for mobile app | Visualforce characteristics, especially the page-centric orientation, can be a poor match for mobile apps with limited, high-latency network connections and limited compute resources. Lightning Components, by contrast, was designed specifically to handle this context.|
| Visualforce | Building a Page-Centric Experience with Limited Client-Side Logic | Use Visualforce pages to ensure development velocity and manageability.|
| Visualforce | Building an Interactive Experience with JavaScript and I Need a Third-Party Framework | Use a Visualforce page as a container for your third-party framework such as React |
