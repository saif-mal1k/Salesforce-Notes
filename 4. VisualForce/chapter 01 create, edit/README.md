## Attributes of ``<apex:page>`` tag
- **sidebar** - this attribute specify if sidebar should be visible or not.
- **showHeader** - to add or remove header, default value is true.
- **standardStylesheets** - to apply or block salesforce style. ex:``standardStylesheets="false"``

## Adding functionality( Standard Controller vs Custom Controller )
<table>
<tr>
<td>

Standard Controller
</td>
<td>

Custom Controller
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

- Standard controllers are powerful prewritten classes atleast one exists for every Salesforce standard object.
- these classes gives basic record operation functionality such as create, read, update, and delete. 
</td>
<td>

- A custom controller is a custom Apex class written by developer to add logic to a page.
- these classes are written to access other objects and fields to create a list of records from multiple objects or update fields across multiple objects.
</td>
</tr>
</table>


> **tip:** 
- You might use custom controllers to run in system mode and bypass all securities. When that happens, you're opting not to enforce permissions or field-level security.
- You can choose whether the class respects a user's organization-wide defaults, role hierarchy, and sharing rules are followed, by using the with sharing keywords in the class definition. 
- For example, if you are using a custom controller and want to honor sharing rules, you define your class in the first line as follows.

```apex
public with sharing class ContactPagination{
}
```
