## Scratch Orgs
- Scratch orgs are empty orgs (no metadata or data) that are easy to create and dispose of as needed.
- You can configure scratch orgs to be different Salesforce editions with different features and preferences.
- What’s more, you can re-use and share the scratch org definition file with other team members, because it’s part of the project integrated into the VCS.
- This way, it’s much simpler for you all to work in the same org configuration while each having your own development environment.

> When you use scratch orgs for development, you first push the source from your project in the VCS to sync the scratch org with the same metadata.
> If you are planning to use Setup for development, the changes you make are tracked automatically.
> You can pull down the modifications you made to include them in your project and use your VCS to commit all the changes.
