## important Notes
- In Test Class you don't work on Existing records, you have to create virtual records, even if you insert a record from test class it is inserted into virtual record base.
- You can save up to 6 MB of Apex code in each org. Test classes annotated with ``@isTest`` donâ€™t count toward this limit.
- Even though test data rolls back, no separate database is used for testing. As a result, for some sObjects that have fields with unique constraints, inserting duplicate sObject records results in an error.
- Test methods donâ€™t send emails.
- Test methods canâ€™t make callouts to external services. You can use mock callouts in tests.
- SOSL searches performed in a test return empty results. To ensure predictable results, use ``Test.setFixedSearchResults()`` to define the records to be returned by the search.
- Even though it is not a best practice to do so, there are times when a test method needs access to pre-existing data. To access org data, annotate the test method with ``@isTest(SeeAllData=true)``.

## importance of Apex Units tests
- Ensuring that your Apex classes and triggers work as expected.
- Having a suite of regression tests that can be rerun every time classes and triggers are updated to ensure that future updates you make to your app donâ€™t break existing functionality.
- Meeting the code coverage requirements for deploying Apex to production or distributing Apex to customers via packages.


<br/>


> ***ðŸ’¡ tip:*** Salesforce runs all Apex tests on your behalf through a process called Apex Hammer. The Hammer process runs in the current version and next release and compares the test results. This process ensures that the behavior in your custom code hasnâ€™t been altered as a result of service upgrades. The Hammer process picks orgs selectively and doesnâ€™t run in all orgs.


<br/>


> ***ðŸ’¡ tip:*** Before you can deploy your code or package it for the Lightning Platform AppExchange, at least 75% of Apex code must be covered by tests, and all those tests must pass. In addition, each trigger must have some coverage.

### Test method Syntax
```apex
  @isTest static void testName() {
      // code_block
  }
```

***Test methods are written in Test classes as:-***
```apex
  @isTest
  private class MyTestClass {
      @isTest static void testName() {
          // code_block
      }
  }
```

**Note:** Test classes can be either private or public. If youâ€™re using a test class for unit testing only, declare it as private. Public test classes are typically used for test data factory classes,

## Setting up test data
<em> "Test data is set up inside the test method, which can be time-consuming as you add more test methods. If you have many test methods, put test-data creation in a test utility class and call the utility class from multiple test methods" </em>

### Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest()
- The test method contains the ``Test.startTest()`` and ``Test.stopTest()`` method pair, which delimits a block of code that gets a fresh set of governor limits.  
- To test that Apex code runs within governor limits, isolate data setupâ€™s limit usage from your testâ€™s. 
- To isolate the data setup processâ€™s limit usage, enclose the test call within the Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() block. 
- Also use this test block when testing asynchronous Apex.

#### Example of @testSetup
  
```apex
@isTest
private class CommonTestSetup {

    @testSetup static void setup() {
        // Create common test accounts
        List<Account> testAccts = new List<Account>();
        for(Integer i=0;i<2;i++) {
            testAccts.add(new Account(Name = 'TestAcct'+i));
        }
        insert testAccts;        
    }
    
    @isTest static void testMethod1() {
        // Get the first test account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct0' LIMIT 1];
        // Modify first account
        acct.Phone = '555-1212';
        // This update is local to this test method only.
        update acct;
        
        // Delete second account
        Account acct2 = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct1' LIMIT 1];
        // This deletion is local to this test method only.
        delete acct2;
        
        // Perform some testing
    }

    @isTest static void testMethod2() {
        // The changes made by testMethod1() are rolled back and 
        // are not visible to this test method.        
        // Get the first account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct = [SELECT Phone FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct0' LIMIT 1];
        // Verify that test account created by test setup method is unaltered.
        System.assertEquals(null, acct.Phone);
        
        // Get the second account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct2 = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct1' LIMIT 1];
        // Verify test account created by test setup method is unaltered.
        System.assertNotEquals(null, acct2);
        
        // Perform some testing
    }

}
