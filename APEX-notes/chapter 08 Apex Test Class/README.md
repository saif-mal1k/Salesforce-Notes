## important Notes
- In Test Class you don't work on Existing records, you have to create virtual records, even if you insert a record from test class it is inserted into virtual record base.
- You can save up to 6 MB of Apex code in each org. Test classes annotated with ``@isTest`` donâ€™t count toward this limit.
- Even though test data rolls back, no separate database is used for testing. As a result, for some sObjects that have fields with unique constraints, inserting duplicate sObject records results in an error.
- Test methods donâ€™t send emails.
- Test methods canâ€™t make callouts to external services. You can use mock callouts in tests.
- SOSL searches performed in a test return empty results. To ensure predictable results, use ``Test.setFixedSearchResults()`` to define the records to be returned by the search.
- Even though it is not a best practice to do so, there are times when a test method needs access to pre-existing data. To access org data, annotate the test method with ``@isTest(SeeAllData=true)``.

## importance of Apex Units tests
- Ensuring that your Apex classes and triggers work as expected.
- Having a suite of regression tests that can be rerun every time classes and triggers are updated to ensure that future updates you make to your app donâ€™t break existing functionality.
- ðŸ’¡ all tests must pass with at least 75% code coverage, for deploying Apex to production or distributing Apex to customers via packages on AppExchange. also, each trigger must have some coverage. 


<br/>


> ***ðŸ’¡ tip:*** Salesforce runs all Apex tests on your behalf through a process called Apex Hammer. The Hammer process compares the test results in current version and new release. This process ensures that the behavior in your custom code hasnâ€™t been altered as a result of service upgrades. The Hammer process picks orgs selectively and doesnâ€™t run in all orgs.

## Example of a test class
```apex
  @isTest
  private class MyTestClass {
  
      //test method syntax
      @isTest static void testName() {
          // code_block
          System.assertEquals(expectedValue, actualValue, 'msg if assert Fails');
      }
      
  }
```

> - The verifications are done by calling the ``System.assertEquals()`` method, which takes two parameters: the first is the ``expected value``, and the second is the ``actual value``. third parameter is ``optional string`` i.e logged if the assertion fails.
> - Test classes can be either ``private`` or ``public``. If youâ€™re using a test class for unit testing only, declare it as private. Public test classes are typically used for test data factory classes,

# Setting up test data
<em> "Test data is set up inside the test method, which can be time-consuming as you add more test methods. If you have many test methods, put test-data creation in a test utility class and call the utility class from multiple test methods" </em>

### Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest()
- The test method contains the ``Test.startTest()`` and ``Test.stopTest()`` method pair, which delimits a block of code that gets a fresh set of governor limits.  
- To test that Apex code runs within governor limits, isolate data setupâ€™s limit usage from your testâ€™s. 
- To isolate the data setup processâ€™s limit usage, enclose the test call within the Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() block. 
- Also use this test block when testing asynchronous Apex. 



<br/>


## using @testSetup
- You can have only one test setup method per test class.
- If an error occurs(_i.e caused by DML operation or an assertion failure_) in test setup method, the entire test class fails, and no further tests in the class are executed.
- test setup methods arenâ€™t supported in classes that are using @isTest(SeeAllData=true) annotation.

#### Example of @testSetup
  
```apex
@isTest
private class CommonTestSetup {

    @testSetup static void setup() {
        // Create common test accounts
        List<Account> testAccts = new List<Account>();
        for(Integer i=0;i<2;i++) {
            testAccts.add(new Account(Name = 'TestAcct'+i));
        }
        insert testAccts;        
    }
    
    @isTest static void testMethod1() {
        // Get the first test account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct0' LIMIT 1];
        // Modify first account
        acct.Phone = '555-1212';
        // This update is local to this test method only.
        update acct;
        
        // Delete second account
        Account acct2 = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct1' LIMIT 1];
        // This deletion is local to this test method only.
        delete acct2;
        
        // Perform some testing
    }

    @isTest static void testMethod2() {
        // The changes made by testMethod1() are rolled back and 
        // are not visible to this test method.        
        // Get the first account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct = [SELECT Phone FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct0' LIMIT 1];
        // Verify that test account created by test setup method is unaltered.
        System.assertEquals(null, acct.Phone);
        
        // Get the second account by using a SOQL query
        Account acct2 = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='TestAcct1' LIMIT 1];
        // Verify test account created by test setup method is unaltered.
        System.assertNotEquals(null, acct2);
        
        // Perform some testing
    }

### test Data factory
```apex

@isTest
public class TestDataFactory {
    public static void createTestRecords(Integer numAccts, Integer numContactsPerAcct) {
        List<Account> accts = new List<Account>();
        
        for(Integer i=0;i<numAccts;i++) {
            Account a = new Account(Name='TestAccount' + i);
            accts.add(a);
        }
        insert accts;
        
        List<Contact> cons = new List<Contact>();
        for (Integer j=0;j<numAccts;j++) {
            Account acct = accts[j];            
            // For each account just inserted, add contacts
            for (Integer k=numContactsPerAcct*j;k<numContactsPerAcct*(j+1);k++) {
                cons.add(new Contact(firstname='Test'+k,
                                     lastname='Test'+k,
                                     AccountId=acct.Id));
            }
        }
        // Insert all contacts for all accounts
        insert cons;
    }
}

```

### using factory from test class
```apex

@isTest
private class MyTestClass {
    @isTest static void testmethod test1() {
        TestDataFactory.createTestRecords(5,3);
        // Run some tests
    }
}

```
