## why use salesforce ?

<br/>

### what is CRM ?
CRM is defined as customer relationship management and is a software system that helps business owners nurture their relationships with their clientele. A CRM also assists with organization, efficiency, time management, and impressing clients.
_"CRM system is any platforms built to manage marketing, sales, customer service, and support, all connected to help companies work more effectively. With a CRM system, businesses can analyze customer interactions and improve their customer relationships."_

<br/>

### Why is CRM needed?
CRM helps businesses build a relationship with their customers that, in turn, creates loyalty and customer retention.
_"CRM solutions can help keep track of contacts within a business, to allow both sales and marketing teams to personalize communication._
<br/>_So, if a contact has moved to a new job, your sales, service, and marketing teams know about it, allowing them to maintain and rebuild these important relationships."_

<br/>

### how was data managed back then with-out CRM ?
it was done manually and stored in files.
Gradually, with the advent of computers companies stored and accessed their data using word documents and excel sheets. 
However, as data started growing, this failed to serve the purpose.
this approach was in-efficient for handling large amount of data.

there was a requirement for a dedicated system to store and analyze data in an effective way to improve customer Satisfaction.
hence, _came the CRM systems for the rescue._

initially these CRM solutions were hosted on the company's own server.
that proved to be costly and ineffective for the small companies or startups.

<p>
  
Companies using big data in conjunction with CRM aim to have systems that can process data in real time and therefore connect with customers faster.
<br/> collecting and analysing big data on their customer. Collecting and analyzing big data on their customers allows companies to augment service by examining customer sentiment.
<br/> Big Objects is the Salesforce's big data solution that can meet your need for storing very large volumes of data (billions of records) in the Salesforce cloud.

hence, there was a need for an affordable and easy to use CRM software accessible from anywhere using web.
this idea gave rise to Salesforce.

***There are three main types of CRM systems:*** 
- **stratergic CRM** - focus on acquiring and maintaining profitable customers.
- **operational CRM** - focus on customer-oriented processes such as selling, marketing, and customer service.
- **analytical CRM** - focus on gathering information (mining of the customer data) and using it tactically for future strategies.
- **collaborative CRM** - focus on integration, so that every one is updared with latest information.

### Difference between CRM and ERP?

***some ERP and CRM features may overlap***

CRM goals:-
- increase sales
- improve customer relationships and prospects.

ERP goals:-
- to improve communication across departments and optimize business processes by providing easy visibility of all operations. 


> _Businesses looking to automate core business processes typically look at two main software solutions,_ **``enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM).``**
> <br/> 
> While the entire organization will come to rely on both ERP and CRM systems, the fundamental difference between ERP and CRM is that ERP is primarily for financial data and the finance department, while CRM is customer data used by the sales and customer service departments.
